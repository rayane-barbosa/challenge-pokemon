# Challenge-Pokemon

This repository contains a JavaScript game where the user has to correctly name a displayed Pokemon in an input field. If the user correctly identifies the Pokemon, they win the game and the Pokemon evolves. The game also features two buttons, one for clearing the display and the other for submitting the response.

## Installation

To run the game, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rayane-barbosa/challenge-pokemon.git
cd challenge-pokemon
```

## Usage

To start the game, open the `index.html` file in your browser. A Pokemon will be displayed on the screen and the user must correctly name the Pokemon in the input field. If the user correctly identifies the Pokemon, they win the game and the Pokemon evolves.

The game also features two buttons:

- **Clear**: This button clears the display and resets the game.
- **Submit**: This button submits the user's response and checks if it is correct.

## API

The game uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to display the Pokemon image. The API is free to use and does not require any authentication.
